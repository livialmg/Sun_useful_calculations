As part of my research project this script was developed to compute several sun's position calculations:

*Declination;
*Time equation;
*True solar time
*Hour angle
*Solar zenith angle
*Azimuth
*Sun-Earth distance
*Daylengh
*Sunrise at a given location
*Sunset at a given location
*Solar noon at a given location

**Convert minutes to hours (minutes varying from 1 to 1440)
